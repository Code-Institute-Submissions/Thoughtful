## **UX** 

### **Project Goals**

Mental health has become a mainstream topic in recent years and it's no wonder considering our busy, stressful, sedentary, and often disconnected lifes. 
[Men in particular seem to suffer and ofter suffer in silence](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/how-can-we-reduce-mens-mental-health-stigma) as they can find it difficult to talk about their thoughts & feelings for fear of judgement. Thoughtful Men 
is based on a combination of a mindfullness technique called [noting](https://www.headspace.com/blog/2017/07/18/noting-technique-take-advantage/) and a [psychology exercises of writing down your thoughts and then throwing away after](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/choke/201301/throw-those-nasty-thoughts-away). The goal of the site then
is to be able to offer a safe and private place for men to write what thoughts come up and then discard them. It is not meant as a replacement for professional help but a way of 
being able to note a thought or feeling and then to discard it to offer some release, or just to simply be mindful of your thoughts. 


### **User Goals**

* In the modern world I am more likely to be close to a computer, tablet or mobile than pen or paper so this has to be accesible on all devices so I can quickley write my thoughts. 
* To provide a simple but beautiful site where I can dive straight in to noting thoughts without prior navigation.  
* Users must be able to trash thoughts for both the effect of psychology release and privacy.  
* To be able to add multiple thoughts in a list with the option of deleting.  
* To offer different color schemes depending on mood of user with a simple click. 
* A contact email to contact the site creator. 
* To provide links for additonal help. 


### **User Stories**

## **Design Choices**

As the idea of the site is to provide a simple page where the user can dive straight in and enter thoughts. 
The designs reflect this with a brief introduction to the purpose and then an input field where the the user can add thoughts. I center aligned everything
as I feel it would look odd with the minimal amout of content to be left or right aligned and its more grabbing. In the input field there will be a plus symbol which I feel is a good representation
to add the thought. Once the user has entered the thought it will appear below the input field with a trash symbol to give the option to discard. 
There will be also be four buttons to allow the user to be able to change the backround color of the site to reflect the mood of the user. 

### **Fonts**

I have decided to go with Roboto regular 400 as my font as it is a clear, concise and common font on the web. It made no sense to use something alternative as it would not fit in with the designs. 


### **Icons**

Icons will be used on the site to provide further usability. There will be an email icon to direct the user to email in the footer and a plus/trash sign for adding and deleting thoughts. They will be taken from [font awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) and chosen to be self explanatory. 


### **Colours**

I want to offer the user the option to be able to change the background colour depending on mood which is what I have done. I have gone for more pastel looking colours as I think 
bright colours or very dark colours would not look very visually appealing on a single simple page. The site will load with a blue colour which is a nice neutral colour. 
Icons will be black in colour to make them stand out and will change to a grey shade when the user hovers on them. 
![Colours](/wireframes/Colours.png)

* Blue is 92D0D6. 
* Green is 91DBA9 
* Yellow is FFEE90. 
* Red is FF8D43. 
* Text colour is black as it shows up clearly on the selected colours and is a very common colour for typing or writing.

## **Wireframes**

To create my wireframes I uses a word processor called pages to create low fidelity frames of the site. 
I chose pages as it is free software with apple mac's and comes with a number of drawing tools and graphical images to help with sketching and visualising the site.

## **Testing**



---

## **Finished site**

### **Background colours changed to images**

During the making of the site I decided against using background colours and instead changed to background images. The reason for this 
is because I feel the images give a better experience to the theme of the site. They are more suited and also frankley visually more appealing than a 
plain background colour. I chose three images which I think suit the site nicley, as they thoughtful and even spiritual. 

### **Removing of links to additional sites**

I decided to remove any links to additional sites as I wanted to keep the site minimal, with the main focus being on the inputting of thoughts. I also thought
it would of been a bit random to have these links in the site. 
Removing these links also meant removing the footer. 

### **Removing of email and social media links**

As with the taking out of additional links I also decided to remove my links to email contact and linkedIn. Firstly I felt there was no real reason to have them
but also they were adding clutter to the site and I preferred to keep it minimal.

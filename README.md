## **UX** 

### **Project Goals**

Mental health has become a mainstream topic in recent years and it's no wonder considering our busy, stressful, sedentary, and often disconnected lifes. 
[Men in particular seem to suffer and ofter suffer in silence](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/how-can-we-reduce-mens-mental-health-stigma) as they can find it difficult to talk about their thoughts & feelings for fear of judgement. Thoughtful Men 
is based on a combination of a mindfullness technique called [noting](https://www.headspace.com/blog/2017/07/18/noting-technique-take-advantage/) and a [psychology exercises of writing down your thoughts and then throwing away after](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/choke/201301/throw-those-nasty-thoughts-away). The goal of the site then
is to be able to offer a safe and private place for men to write what thoughts come up and then discard them. It is not meant as a replacement for professional help but a way of 
being able to note a thought or feeling and then to discard it to offer some release, or just to simply be mindful of your thoughts. 


### **User Goals**

* In the modern world we are more likely to be close to a computer, tablet or mobile than pen or paper so this has to be accesible on all devices so users can quickley write their thoughts. 
* To provide a simple but beautiful site where the user can dive straight in to noting thoughts without prior navigation.  
* Users must be able to trash their thoughts for both the effect of psychology release and privacy.  
* To be able to add multiple thoughts in a list with the option of deleting.  
* To offer different color schemes depending on mood of user with a simple click. 
* A contact email to contact the site creator. 
* To provide links for additonal help. 


### **User Stories**

* As a user I want to be able to access the site either at home on a desktop or on the go with mobile/tablet. 
* As a user I want to be able to write my thought or feeling with the option of deleting immediately or later.  
* As a user I want to be able to be able to do this without prior navigation.  
* As a user I want to be able to contact the site owner. 
* As a user I want to have links to additional information on mental health and meditation. 

### **Site Owner Goals**

* As a site owner in this busy modern world I want the site to be straight to the point with information easy to find.
* As a site owner I want clearly labelled navigation links and as little clicking and scrolling as possible for the user to stand out from the competition 
and give the impression that African Explorers are an efficient and professional company. 
* As a site owner I want to provide a pleasing to the eye site so the user leaves with a good feeling. 
* As a site owner I want to provide images of the tours/animals to fire the users imagination and give them a taste of the wilderness. 
* As a site owner I want to have a scrolling testimonials section of our tours and a recent sightings section to add to user excitement of what could be expected on a tour.  
* As a site owner I want the user to be able to contact us via their preferred communication channel. 

### **User Requirements and Expectations**

## **Design Choices**

The average age of a buying customer for safari travel is [50 years old](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/how-can-we-reduce-mens-mental-health-stigma) (actually a drop from 70 over the last 20 years) showing that it is a form of travel most popular with working middle aged professionals.

This was very much on my mind when designing the site. People of this age are more likely to be busy with work, commutes, and family commitments meaning time is more precious.  Because of this I want the site to be of minimalist design, straight to the point and with key information easily findable with little searching. 
I didn't feel the need for alternative street style fonts & colours which would appeal to a younger audience for example. 

People of this age group are also likely to be on the move a lot due work & family travel commitments so I have a decided to go with a mobile first design with Bootstrap. 

### **Fonts**

Considering the likely age user group of the website I decided to us Roboto regular 400 as my font as it is "safe", very easy to read, and neutral. I did not think it would be right to go too creative in this case. An interesting article on [safe web fonts](https://websitesetup.org/web-safe-fonts-html-css/)


### **Icons**

Icons will be used alongside the text of navigation links to provide further usability. They will be taken from [font awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) and chosen to be self explanatory. 


### **Colours**

The colour scheme was chose on the basis that I wanted a simple, clean and visually appealing site that was emotive of colours associated with an African safari. 
![Colours](/wireframes/colours.png)

* For the navigation bar I will be using 41B45A Green Pantone which is a nice friendly colour and I thought green is the colour most associated with nature. 
* Background colour of site will be FAFAFA white to keep it clean and easy to contrast against.  
* When user scroll over navigation links the shade of green will change to 15795B a darker shade of green (Spanish Viridian) to show the highlight to the user which link they will be pressing. 
* For the testimonial and latest sighting sections of the site the background colour will be F2E7CF Champagne which will give the area a subtle highlight to draw attention and is a shade of brown/yellow found on the African plains.
* Text colour through the site will be black. This was chosen as it easy to read on all colours chosen.

## **Wireframes**

![Wireframes](/wireframes/index.png)

To create my wireframes I uses a software called Balsamiq to create low fidelity frames of the site. 
I chose Balsamiq as it is user friendly and allows you to add graphical images which I find very helpful for visualising the site. For example the graphics
with the navigation links and the scrolling testimonials really allowed me to get an idea of how the site could look. 

I did find a slight issue with Balsamiq and that was when the desktop wireframes were exported the line under the navigation links was extended to look messy. It should be noted this is not an intentional design. 

As I am building this site to be responsive it was very important for me to produce wireframes of desktop, mobile, and tablet. Click on the link below to see in more detail.

## **Testing**

For testing the site I used the following tools/methods. 
### [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools)
This proved very useful in the production of the site as it allowed me to not only fix bugs whilst creating the site but I could also play around with what styling worked best on different screen sizes. It has an inbuilt features to view my site in responsive and handheld devices. 

![Chrome tools big screen](/assets/images/Chrome-tools-1.jpg)
![Chrome tools small screen](/assets/images/Chrome-tools-2.jpg)

### [W3C HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/) 
This was used to check my HTML for errors. It found the below errors which I fixed by removing type="button" which was not necessary.
I was also able to remove an redundant id="nav-image" which if used should have actually been a class as it was used more than once for styling. 
After fixing these issues the results returned as no errors.

**Now no errors after fix**

### [W3C CSS Jigsaw validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

**Pheww no errors first time!!**

![CSS validator no errors](/assets/images/CSS-Validator-no-errors.jpg)

### [Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/)

I used Autoprefixer to analyse the sites compatibility with different browsers. By running by CSS code
through autoprefixer it automatically shows me where I need to add webkit and moz to render with Safari and Chrome. An example is below:

![Autoprefixer](assets/images/autoprefixer.jpg)

## Manual Testing 

I first tested the site on different browser to see the results. As you can see from below my only issues being with Internet Explorer. 
![Manual Testing Browsers](/assets/images/manual-testing-browsers.jpg)

## Responsiveness

Next I tested the site on different devices (small, medium, and large) and bootstrap media breakpoints using Chrome Developer tools. Below are my results:
![Manual Testing Responsive](/assets/images/manual-testing-responsive.png)


## Speed

I tested the speed of the site using [Pingdom](https://tools.pingdom.com/) a free website. It returned the below result.

![Speed](/assets/images/page-speed.jpg)

It returned a grade C so could be better but it still loads in under a second which is a good load speed. 

## Contact form

With the contact form the main two things I wanted to check was that if information was not filled in a required field it would display an error message which it did. The second aspect being that once filled in and the send button hit it
returned a message saying "this is just a sample form and your data has not been sent anywhere, which it did.

## **Bugs**

This are issues I encountered during the building of the site that I was able to fix as I went along. 

### **Jumbotron**

The issue I had with the jumbotron was that the background image and text were not fully responsive on handheld devices. It seems it is a common problem with Bootstrap jumbotrons and there are a few methods to fix it. 

The best solution for the text was to use media queries to alter the size and placement (via margin) depending on screen size. 

For the background image could have used the same approach but it would take a lot of time tweaking the size and positioning of the element and may still not look great. In the end I decided to switch the background image for another one which had better
proportions for smaller devices using media queries. 

### **Carousel**

I had a similar issue with the carousel testimonial section on the landing page in that the slider and next/previous buttons would overlap either on the side or below on smaller devices. From a design point of view I decided to remove them on mobile devices
as I felt it would be fiddly to use the buttons on smaller screens away. It automatic moves through the quotes so not essential to have them. 

### **About us section** 

Due to the design layout of the about us section it caused a lot of difficulties in different screen sizes. The elements would often lose spacing between them and the bottom image would not stretch. 

I tried to fix this issue with different media queries at various sizes but the elements moved so much that it was easier to redesign the look of the site. I still had to add a media query for tablet/laptop size as large white space appeared
on the right hand side when the recent sightings section would disappear as planned. 

### **Anchor links**

Another bug I had was with the anchor links to navigate around the site. Due to having a fixed navbar it would cut out the top 100px of each section when navigating. 
I had to add to the html document in the css file scroll-padding-top: 100px to fix this. 

### **Footer**

I noticed with my footer that on some smaller devices the footer would float up the page. I had to fix this using media queries and changing the height to 100%.

## **Finished site**

### **Additonal fonts used in finished site**

In the finished site I also used a font called Pangolin, cursive as I wanted to give a different style to the title in the navbar to give more of a logo look and feel to it. I felt this font suited the African theme and it is even named after a rare
nocturnal animal found in Southern Africa. This font was also used for the title on the recent sightings section and within the jumbotron.

I also used a second additional font in the recent sightings section called Patrick Hand cursive as this is a handwritten style of font which I thought suited the section as it is meant to be like a recent sightings posting they have in national parks.

### **Additonal colour used in finished site**

An additional colour of 91D18B which is a light green was added as a background colour to the image gallery section of the site. This is because the site was changed to a single page layout on advise from one of my mentors and I needed
to signify a new section. The colour visually matched well with the rest of the site and suits the theme (safari).

### **Design changes**

There has been a few design changes made from original UX designs that should be noted below:

### **NavBar**
As I was using Bootstrap I decided to go with a bootstrap navbar rather than my custom made one as it more time effective and has built in responsiveness with a hamburger icon in smaller devices. 
I was still able to fully customise to my font and colour schemes with CSS so it was an effective decision. 

### **Full page background image**
I decided to go with a full page background image rather than a banner and additional images. I think this provided a much cleaner and grabbing look to the site and it allowed me to 
be creative and change the background image with different devices.

### **Redesign of about us section**
As explained in the bugs section due to responsiveness issues it proved more efficient to redesign to a simpler layout. 

### **Additional call to action button**
I added a click to contact us button on the about us section as well to provide an additional click to see images button for easier navigation.

### **Change to single page site** 
After discuss with one of my mentors it was advised that due to this being a simple site with not a lot of content it was recommended I switch to a single page site.
